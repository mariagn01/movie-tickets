# Movie Tickets üçø
Hi üëã This is a webapplication for ordering movie tickets, based on a course project from my Bachelor's in Software Engineering.

## About the project
This fullstack web application allows users to order movie tickets. Users can view a list of their purchased tickets, with an option to delete tickets if needed. The application is designed with responsiveness in mind and includes error handling on both the client and server sides.

## Key Features
- Purchasing, viewing and deleting tickets
- Tickets are stored on a server using an in-memory database (H2)
- Responsive design, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices
- Error handling, both client-side and server-side to ensure a reliable user experience

## Technologies used
- HTML is used for basic structure and form elements
- CSS & Bootstrap for styling and responsive design.
- JavaScript for handling ticket objects, form submission, and interaction with the server.
- Java (Spring Boot) on the server side to manage ticket storage and communication with the H2 memory-database.
- H2 Memory Database for data storage during runtime
- IDE used is IntelliJ IDEA
